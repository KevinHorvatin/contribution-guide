##Contents:

- [System Overview](./system-overview.md) provides an overview of the different subsystems within the Tessel architecture and how they interact with each other.
- [Building From Source](./build-from-source.md) walks you through the tools needed to compile and run the various subsystems of Tessel.
- [The Contribution Process](./contribution-process.md) explains the ideal process for fixing bugs, adding features, and submitting code to be merged into production.
- [The Current Task List](./task-list.md) is a living document with bite-sized (and some not-so-bite-sized) bug fixes or features that we've been meaning to add but haven't had the time. If you finish one, we'll send you a thank you package.
